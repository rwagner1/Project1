\caption{(A): Ants following a trail between food source and their nest. (B): An obstacle is placed to interrupt the track of the ants. (C): The column of ants splits into two groups each choosing a different way to circumvent the obstacle. (D): Due to the higher concentration of pheromone all ants have chosen the shortest path.}
